# R Code 1 Information Page

Hi! Welcome to my R Work Repo. This repo contains examples of my work utilizing the R language. Below is a brief description of each work along with the dataset utilized. 

1) <b>File</b>: Black_Friday_Analysis.Rmd

<b>Dataset</b>: Black Friday Sales Data - Kaggle

<b>Analysis</b> - In this analysis, we explore what the black friday sales data looks like. Some basic takeaways from the analysis appear that a larger percentage of shoppers are males between the age of 26-35.

2) <b>File</b>: Clustering and Kmeans.Rmd

<b>Dataset</b>: Provided by professor Brad Price - West Virginia University

<b>Analysis</b>: This file is designed to show the knowledge and understanding of clustering algorithms. 

3) <b>File</b>: Coins, Cars and Land Prices.Rmd

<b>Dataset</b>: ALR4 datasets within the base R Studio. The specific datasets are Jevons Coin Collection, stopping distance for vehicles and MinnLand Land price datset. - Base R Studio

<b>Analysis</b>: This file contains 3 different analysis. This illustrates the ability to work with various statistical techniques and datasets.

4) <b>File</b>: College Data Analysis.Rmd

<b>Dataset</b>: College application dataset in the ISLR package of R Studio.

<b>Analysis</b>: This file contains a demonstration of bootstrapping a dataset and looks at the US News and World Report on College data and Applications. 

5) <b>File</b>: Ebola_Study.Rmd

<b>Dataset</b>: Outbreaks of Ebola to prior to the 2014 West Africa outbreak. - Mylne, Adrian; Huang, Zhi; Pigott, David; Kraemer, Moritz; Hay, Simon; Brady, Oliver; et al. (2014): Ebola past outbreak geographic spread GIS polygon data (.shp). figshare. Dataset.

<b>Analysis:</b> This file contains a breakdown and somewhat classification of Ebola outbreaks prior to 2014. The reason this dataset was chosen was that the outbreak in 2014 gained international news as many countries raced to develop protection measures against transmission by migration/travel. The 2014 outbreak total toll is still unknown but in exploring previous history about Ebola outbreaks, we see that many outbreaks began in the heavily forested areas of Democratic Republic of the Congo and areas west. It also shows that many cases start in the remote regions where mining operations are prevelant. This creates a very interesting backstory and provides some understanding of what drives Ebola outbreaks and where to focus detection and mitigation risks.

6) <b>File</b>: Financial_Analysis.Rmd

<b>Dataset</b> - Live Stock Ticket - Yahoo

<b>Analysis</b>: This file contains a brief analysis of MYL as it pertains to stock pricing. The idea behind this file is to work with pulling live data from an API and provide updated analysis.

7) <b>File:</b> Flights and Wine Time.Rmd

<b>Dataset</b>: TTR Library and AirPassengers Data - Base R Studio

<b>Analysis:</b> This file utilizes a base R library to illustrate an understanding and ability to work with time series data within R. 

8) <b>File:</b> Modeling Co-Usage WVU BUDA Capstone 2.Rmd

<b>Dataset:</b> SAMHSA Data from 1990 - 2016

<b>Analysis:</b> This file is of particular interest. This Rmd contains our graduate capstone project in which we explore the relationship between public drug treatment facilities and reoccurrance. We saw several interesting topics within the analysis. One item that stood out against everything was that we often saw cohorts of users seeking treatment as they moved along in age. We also saw that a majority of drug use is not related to college aged individuals but those in their 30's. After which we saw the number of those seeking treatment taper off until it dropped significantly in 40's - 50's.

9) <b>File:</b> Venezuela_Cryptocurrency.Rmd

<b>Dataset:</b> Currency data & Crypto Currency data - Venezuela

<b>Analysis:</b> This file explored the value and growth of the Petrocoin against the geopolitical backdrop of Venezuelas inflation problem. The petrocoin was a government backed cryptocurrency that was introduced as a means for combatting inflation within Venezuela. The reason for this was that during the instability, the local currency grew to be pretty much worthless. The petrocoin was also used to try and evade international sanctions against Venezuela by allowing trade on alternative markets that are not governed by major powers. The petrocoin did enjoy a brief climb but did notably crash as tensioned continued to rise. 

10) <b>File:</b> Wages Analysis of Information VS Industrial.Rmd

<b>Dataset:</b> Wage data from the ISLR package in R Studio

<b>Analysis:</b> This file utilized splines and the wage data to explore the non linear relationship between those who had advanced degrees and their expected/reported wages. Reported wage data did exhibit a noted favor towards those with advanced degrees vs those who have only a High School education.
